# Machine-Translation-Using-Encoder-Decoder-Model
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a machine translation model using an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM for translating English sentences to French. The model is trained on a dataset of English-French sentence pairs and uses TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network.
